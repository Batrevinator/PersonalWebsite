I found the \"classic\" rental experience to be tedious and felt I could find ways to improve it. There is now a working prototype of automated payment management. I have since brought it to RIT to be proposed as a senior project for the 2025-2026 school year. Here I hope the increased developer count will propell the project forward to a working product.",
